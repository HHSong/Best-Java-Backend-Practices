# Best Java Backend Practices
 -- by Hao Hsiang Song

Coding is far beyond getting the outputs right, especially when that becomes a hobby.
Along my journey as a backend developer, I realize I am not writing codes for just myself, but also people that I am working with. Clean codes and sophisticated designs are so much like art pieces that it takes time to learn to see the value. Therefore, I decided to explan each and every good practices of server-side programming.
