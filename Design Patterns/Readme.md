#### Creation Patterns
1. [Builder](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#1-builder)
: create things in a Lego style
2. [Factory Method & Abstract Factory](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#2-factory-method--abstract-factory) 
: default settings satifies you
3. [Prototype](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#3-prototype-clone-over-new)
: great artists steal
4. [Pool and Singleton](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#4-pool-and-singleton)
: the world is too crowded

#### Structure Patterns
1. [Adapter](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#1-adapter)
: face off
2. [Bridge](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#2-bridge)
: addition instead of multiplication
3. [Composite](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#3-composite)
: well... I guess you messed up your data structure with data
4. [Decorator](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#4-decorator)
: when Iron Man puts on Hulkbuster, you get the idea
5. [Facade](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#5-facade)
: a bunny hill to your library
6. [Flyweight](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#6-flyweight)
: BYOB to your favorite place
7. [Proxy](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#7-proxy)
: the moment you realize the person you're talking to isn't in charge

#### Behavior Patterns
1. Chain of Responsibility
: Anarchism works, at least in your code
2. Command
: 
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
