# Design Patterns
 -- by Hao Hsiang Song

"There is nothing new under the sun." That explains the existence of design patterns. Every new features or problems could be decomposed into one or more commonly seen problems. And the solutions to them are well known the programmers' world.

#### Creation Patterns
1. [Builder](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#1-builder)
: create things in a Lego style
2. [Factory Method & Abstract Factory](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#2-factory-method--abstract-factory) 
: default settings satifies you
3. [Prototype](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#3-prototype-clone-over-new)
: great artists steal
4. [Pool and Singleton](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Creation#4-pool-and-singleton)
: the world is too crowded

#### Structure Patterns
1. [Adapter](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#1-adapter)
: face off
2. [Bridge](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#2-bridge)
: addition instead of multiplication
3. [Composite](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#3-composite)
: well... I guess you wanna mess up your data structure with the data type
4. [Decorator](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#4-decorator)
: when Iron Man puts on Hulkbuster, you get the idea
5. [Facade](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#5-facade)
: a bunny hill to your library
6. [Flyweight](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#6-flyweight)
: BYOB to your favorite place
7. [Proxy](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Structure#7-proxy)
: the moment you realize the person you're talking to isn't in charge

#### Behavior Patterns
1. [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#1-chain-of-responsibility)
: anarchism works, at least in your code
2. [Command](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#2-command)
: your code shoud be as simple as pushing a button
3. [Interpreter](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#3-interpreter)
: reading an input and parsing to a structure
4. [Iterator](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#4-iterator)
: holding data is not the same responsibility as walking you through
5. [Mediator](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#5-mediator)
: it sucks when you have to talk to five people separately just to get a thing done
6. [Memento](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#6-memento)
: life is easier if you can start over
7. [Observer](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#7-observer-aka-subscriber-aka-listerner)
: sometimes you just want to shut up and listen
8. [State](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#8-state)
: finite state machine, if that rings a bell
9. [Strategy](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#9-strategy)
: in short, this is Java
10. [Template Method](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#10-template-method)
: you direct a show but let the actors improvise
11. [Visitor](https://github.com/HHSong/Best-Java-Backend-Practices/tree/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavior#11-visitor)
: lol think about it, it's exact a callback
